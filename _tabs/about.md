New Jersey native currently living in Baltimore with my wife, son and pet cactus. I am an MD working in Bioinformatics and I enjoy learning about medicine, psychiatry, and data science (buzzwords!). 

In my spare time I enjoy purchasing golf equipment that I don’t need, choosing the longest lines at the ski lift, and finding increasingly involved ways to make coffee.
