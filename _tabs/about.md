New Jersey native living 15 minutes from where I went to college with my wife, son, and pet cactus. I am an MD working in Bioinformatics and I enjoy learning about medicine, psychiatry, and data science (buzzwords!).

In my spare time I enjoy purchasing golf equipment that I don’t need, choosing the longest lines at the ski lift, and finding increasingly involved ways to make coffee.
