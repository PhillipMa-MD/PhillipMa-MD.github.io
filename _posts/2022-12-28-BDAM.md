I love Big Dumb Action Movies. I'll get into the disambiguation of what I mean by BDAMs in a minute, but I just wanted to get that out of the way so you'd know where I stand: not here to bury the lede. 

I took a film class my senior year in college because I decided I wanted to be *cultured*. I did actually end up learning a lot about the history of cinema, as well as lots of different ways to appreciate film. Things like cinematography, set/sound/costume design, editing etc etc where covered in class. To a lesser extent, taking some other English-type courses prepped me to appreciate story/screenplay/character-development. Not to say one needs to take a film class to notice any of these things. Something I say often about anything I do or care about is that not a lot of things are really that hard, it's just a lot. With time, most people can learn about anything if they try hard enough. Film (or TV nowadays for that matter) is probably one of the more accessible intellectual pursuits since lots of people watch lots of things. After getting into watching films in a more nunanced way however, I eschewed the BDAM in favor of more arthouse fare. I suddenly got too good for a good ol' action flick. This was a mistake and I hope to correct anyone who might feel this way. 

But anyway. The scene is set I guess for me to explain what it is I am even getting at.

Don't ask stupid questions. You know what a BDAM is. They're big! Big budget! Big stars! Big set pieces! Big action! Big box office! Top Gun Maverick! All the Fast and Furious Movies! Independence Day! Armageddon! Point Break! I could go on forever really. 

This may sound ironic shortly, but there is an archetype of movie-goer who scoffs at movies like these: I was one of them. How pretentious Phil would describe them would emphasize the dumb part. The story was dumb and full of plot holes. The action is over-the-top and ridiculous. The characters are shallow and lack motivation. These movies are made for brainless idiots and I am too smart and cultured to bother with common drivel. 

Those people are wrong. 

But actually they're sorta right. These are all fair criticisms of the 'genre', but they all miss the forrest for the trees. The BDAM is not made to tell a story. They are spectacle crafted to make you feel a certain way. The highs are meant to be so high that they take the audience with them! You watch to be in awe at the sheer scale of the action and the emotion. Yes! Emotion! A movie does not need to be in subtle and 4 hours long to invoke emotions! 

And these movies are certainly not made *by* dumb people. It is incredibly hard to make a movie that lifts an entire audience out of their seats and shed a tear all in a neat 2 hours! Sure the story may not be airtight in the tiny details, but that does not make it dumb. An action movie without a proper story is terrible! Let's run through an example of one of my all-time favorites: Armageddon.

Story -> Motivation

Action -> Emotion
